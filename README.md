This project is part of an introductory course on programming concepts, specifically focusing on while loops and input validation. The assignment involves completing the game "NIMGRAB" by implementing logical structures in Python to handle various game operations. The nimGrab.py file provided includes TODO comments to guide the tasks that need to be completed.

Features:

Implementing game loops using while statements
Input validation for player actions
Logical thinking to handle game flow
Feel free to review the code and explore how the game functions!
